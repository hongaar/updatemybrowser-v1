# Ajde is a web framework to kickstart your PHP projects

*Yet another PHP 5.0 MVC framework with out-of-the-box HTML / CSS / JS / caching and HTTP optimizations. Your project will be fast and cutting edges right from the start!*

**PLEASE NOTE: Ajde is in an early alpha stage, and the API is still changing.**

## Getting Started with Ajde

### A framework for Grade A performance

Ajde aims to be a framework for creating fast websites. Employing out-of-the box minifiers + combining for resources and caching them to relieve your server, taking care of all the right headers and .htaccess settings for you, Ajde lifts the performance of your application to a next level.

It does all this with being less than 325 kB in size.

### A framework for designers

A simple to use API and a straightforward templating system for your web application. Ajde will automatically include your related JavaScript and stylesheets if you follow the naming convention and you can write your templates in native PHP or entirely in pre-parsed XHTML.

Our main goal is to facilitate you writing your template and navigation structure fast with no need to compile or run any scripts. We provide the latest, state-of-the-art, hand-crafted HTML 5 boilerplate to get you started, a reset.css is included and JavaScript libraries can be loaded dynamically as needed.

Writing your application logic and extending Ajde is easy and extensive exception handling is turned on by default for the development environment.

### A framework for developers

Onboard support for multiple languages?, human readable (SEO) URLs, event binding, session and cookie management, security measures, and external libraries. Ajde is a MVC framework only, but provides you with a database abstraction layer (based on PDO, MySQL adapter available) and an easy CRUD interface?.

It follows the naming conventions of the Zend Framework and you can use most of the ZF components in your application. We already streamlined inclusion of this library for you! (Just put it in the lib/ directory, but beware, the small footprint of your application will be gone...)
